    <!--Description-->
    <p>Creamy, velvety flan is one of the world’s most popular desserts, and it’s easy to see why. Made from straightforward ingredients, it has a spoonable, rich texture and it bakes up with its own irresistible caramel sauce on top. Variations abound throughout Latin America and beyond, but almost all are deliciously recognizable. Here’s exactly what flan is and everything else you need to know about this crowd-pleasing custard.</p>

       <h2> Steps to make your flan  ! </h2>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
       </ol>
